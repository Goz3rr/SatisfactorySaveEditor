* Automatically create backups before saving in case you break your save
* Delete broken content or fix duplicated milestones caused by mod bugs.

* (Should) support any modded content serialized in the game save
* Manually edit data tags

* Unlock all milestones (to make a testing map, for example)
* Search your save for certain information
* Determine the location of resource nodes

# FAQ

* None of the changes I'm making are doing anything in game.

Are you sure you're using `File > Save` to save after making your changes?

* I'm trying to use the `Unlock all research` cheat, but it isn't working!

Some people have encountered issues if they don't complete HUB tier 0 before running this cheat. Try that, and contact us if the issue continues.

* The editor crashed!

Please create a [github issue](https://github.com/Goz3rr/SatisfactorySaveEditor/issues/new) with the details of what you were doing before the editor crashed, and include the save file you were editing if you'd like. Please contact us on Discord (above) as well.
